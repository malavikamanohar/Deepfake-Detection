# Deepfake-Detection
DL-Based Solution for Detection of Face-Swap Deep Fake Photos
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based solution for detecting face-swap deep fake images. With the rapid rise of social media platforms, fake or edited images are increasingly being used to spread misinformation, causing significant harm. Basically our main goal is to create an efficient image classification system capable of accurately identifying deep fake images.
